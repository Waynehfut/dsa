# Welcome to Data Structure and Algorithm

[中文](readme.md)

## About

Hello! My name is **Hao Wang**.
Welcome to join the Data Structure and Algorithm(DSA).
In this lesson we will explore the basic ideas and tools
about data structure and use these ideas and tools to build
interesting algorithm to solve the real-world problem.

## Prerequisites course

- Fundamentals of Programming
- Introduction to Computers(Optional)

## Teach Assistant

- [XX](site here) (Available in 3:00-5:00pm Friday, every teaching week)

## Notices

In this lesson, programming is not the most important part.
Most time of the class is focus on understanding the design idea of DSA
and its application scenarios. We prefer to use Java or C/C++ for coding,
but not restrict the programming language.
